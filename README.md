UJAS (Universal Job Application System) an Open-Source hiring platfor designed by me a Visionary, built by a community.

This is going to be a complete alternative to expensive ATS/HR systems designed to be self-hosted, 100% customized and completely free with paid addons, or paid hosting if they can't host themselves.

The Problem
Companies spend $10,000-$100,000/year on hiring software.  Applicants face clunky, repetitive application processes.  No open-source solution exists that's both comprehensive and enterprise-ready.  Vendor lock-in prevents customization and innovation

The Solution
Free forever (self-hosted) or Paid (We host it).  Open source (MIT License).  Community-driven (you help build it).  Enterprise-ready (white-label, scalable, secure)

Our plans
90 Second application time.  You go on company website apply using custom javescript code or QR code.  Select the location and position your applying for, answer custom questions and submit. Saving alot of time and more aqurate information.
