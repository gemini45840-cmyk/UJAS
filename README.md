# UJAS – Universal Job Application System 85% Completed

**UJAS** is an open-source hiring platform designed and led by a visionary, self-taught programmer and built by the community.

It is a **complete alternative to expensive ATS/HR systems**, designed to be **self-hosted**, **fully customizable**, and **free forever**, with optional paid add-ons or managed hosting for teams that don’t want to host it themselves.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

- Companies spend **$10,000–$100,000 per year** on hiring software  
- Applicants face **clunky, repetitive application processes**  
- No open-source solution exists that is both **comprehensive** and **enterprise-ready**  
- Vendor lock-in prevents **customization, innovation, and ownership**

---

## 💡 The Solution

UJAS gives hiring power back to companies and candidates.

- **Free forever** when self-hosted  
- **Paid managed hosting** available ($49/month)  
- **Open-source (MIT License)**  
- **Community-driven development**  
- **Enterprise-ready** (white-label, scalable, secure)
