🎯 The Vision
"I've designed the world's most comprehensive hiring platform. Now I need YOUR help to build it."

UJAS (Universal Job Application System) is a complete open-source alternative to expensive ATS/HR systems like Greenhouse, Lever, and Workday. It's designed to be self-hostable by any company, 100% customizable, and completely free.

The Problem
Companies spend $10,000-$100,000/year on hiring software

Applicants face clunky, repetitive application processes

No open-source solution exists that's both comprehensive and enterprise-ready

Vendor lock-in prevents customization and innovation

The Solution
UJAS is what WordPress did for websites, but for hiring:

Free forever (self-hosted)

Open source (MIT License)

Community-driven (you help build it)

Enterprise-ready (white-label, scalable, secure)

✨ Why This Project is Different
Traditional ATS	UJAS
Cost	$5,000-$50,000/year	FREE (self-hosted)
Customization	Limited, expensive	Unlimited (open source)
Innovation	Slow vendor updates	Community-driven, rapid updates
Data Ownership	Vendor controls your data	You own your data
Exit Strategy	Painful migration	Zero lock-in
Our Unique Features (Planned):
QR Code Applications - Scan to apply anywhere

Real-Time Transparency - Track applications like Uber

90-Second Apply - Pre-filled from profiles

Custom Assessment Builder - Create tests in minutes

Complete White-label - Your brand, not ours

Plugin Marketplace - Extend with 100+ plugins
